# GoRouter

This repository contains the source code for a Go implementation of the Cloud
Foundry router.

You can find the old router [here](http://github.com/cloudfoundry-attic/router)

## Getting started

The following instructions may help you get started with gorouter in a
standalone environment.

### External Dependencies

- Go should be installed and in the PATH
- GOPATH should be set as described in http://golang.org/doc/code.html
- [gnatsd](https://github.com/apcera/gnatsd) installed and in the PATH
- [godep](https://github.com/tools/godep) installed and in the PATH
- Install [direnv](http://direnv.net/) if you are planning to do gorouter
development as part of cf-release.

### Development Setup

Download gorouter:

Option 1: GoRouter (standalone)
```bash
go get -d github.com/cloudfoundry/gorouter
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/cloudfoundry/gorouter
```

Option 2: GoRouter (as part of [cf-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release))
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release
cd cf-release
./update
cd cf-release/src/github.com/cloudfoundry/gorouter
```
 *Note: direnv will automatically set your GOPATH when you cd into the gorouter directory. You will need to run `direnv allow` the first time.*


To install exactly the dependencies vendored with gorouter, use [godep](https://github.com/tools/godep):

```bash
go get -v github.com/tools/godep
godep restore ./...
```




### Running Tests

We are using [Ginkgo](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo), to run tests.

Running `scripts/test` will:
- Check for Go
- Check that GOPATH is set
- Download & Install gnatsd (or use the one already downloaded into the GOPATH)
- Update the PATH to prepend the godep workspace
- Install ginkgo (from the godep vendored sources into the godep workspace bin)
- Run all the tests with ginkgo (in random order, without benchmarks, using the vendored godep dependencies)

Any flags passed into `scripts/test` will be passed into ginkgo.

```bash
# run all the tests
scripts/test

# run only tests whose names match Registry
scripts/test -focus=Registry

# run only the tests in the registry package
scripts/test registry
```

To run the tests using GOPATH dependency sources (bypassing vendored dependencies):

```bash
ginkgo -r
```

### Building
Building creates an executable in the gorouter/ dir:

```bash
go build
```

### Installing
Installing creates an executable in the $GOPATH/bin dir:

```bash
go install
```

### Start

```bash
# Start NATS server in daemon mode
go get github.com/apcera/gnatsd
gnatsd &

# Start gorouter
gorouter
```

### Usage

When the gorouter starts, it sends a `router.start` message.
This message contains an interval that other components should then send `router.register` on, `minimumRegisterIntervalInSeconds`.
It is recommended that clients should send `router.register` messages on this interval.
This `minimumRegisterIntervalInSeconds` value is configured through the `start_response_delay_interval` configuration value.
The gorouter will prune routes that it considers to be stale based upon a seperate "staleness" value, `droplet_stale_threshold`, which defaults to 120 seconds.
The gorouter will check if routes have become stale on an interval defined by `prune_stale_droplets_interval`, which defaults to 30 seconds.
All of these values are represented in seconds and will always be integers.

The format of the `router.start` message is as follows:

```json
{
  "id": "some-router-id",
  "hosts": ["1.2.3.4"],
  "minimumRegisterIntervalInSeconds": 5,
  "prunteThresholdInSeconds": 120,
}
```
After a `router.start` message is received by a client, the client should send `router.register` messages. This ensures that the new router can update its routing table and synchronize with existing routers.

If a component comes online after the router, it must make a NATS request
called `router.greet` in order to determine the interval. The response to this
message will be the same format as `router.start`.

The format of the `router.register` message is as follows:

```json
{
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 4567,
  "uris": [
    "my_first_url.vcap.me",
    "my_second_url.vcap.me"
  ],
  "tags": {
    "another_key": "another_value",
    "some_key": "some_value"
  },
  "app": "some_app_guid",
  "stale_threshold_in_seconds": 120,
  "private_instance_id": "some_app_instance_id"
}
```
`stale_threshold_in_seconds` is the custom staleness threshold for the route being registered. If this value is not sent, it will default to the router's default staleness threshold.
`app` is a unique identifier for an application that the route is registered for. It is used to emit router access logs associated with the app through dropsonde.
`private_instance_id` is a unique identifier for an instance associated with the app identified by the `app` field. `X-CF-InstanceID` is set to this value on the request to the endpoint registered.

Such a message can be sent to both the `router.register` subject to register
URIs, and to the `router.unregister` subject to unregister URIs, respectively.

###Example

Create a simple app
```
$ nohup ruby -rsinatra -e 'get("/") { "Hello!" }' &
```

Send a register message
```
$ nats-pub 'router.register' '{"host":"127.0.0.1","port":4567,"uris":["my_first_url.vcap.me","my_second_url.vcap.me"],"tags":{"another_key":"another_value","some_key":"some_value"}}'

Published [router.register] : '{"host":"127.0.0.1","port":4567,"uris":["my_first_url.vcap.me","my_second_url.vcap.me"],"tags":{"another_key":"another_value","some_key":"some_value"}}'
```

See that it works!
```
$ curl my_first_url.vcap.me:8081
Hello!
```

### Instrumentation

The `/varz` endpoint provides status and metrics. This endpoint requires basic authentication. 

```
$ curl "http://someuser:somepass@10.0.32.15:8080/varz"
{"bad_gateways":0,"bad_requests":20,"cpu":0,"credentials":["user","pass"],"droplets":26,"host":"10.0.32.15:8080","index":0,"latency":{"50":0.001418144,"75":0.00180639025,"90":0.0070607187,"95":0.009561058849999996,"99":0.01523927838000001,"samples":1,"value":5e-07},"log_counts":{"info":9,"warn":40},"mem":19672,"ms_since_last_registry_update":1547,"num_cores":2,"rate":[1.1361328993362565,1.1344545494448148,1.1365784133171992],"requests":13832,"requests_per_sec":1.1361328993362565,"responses_2xx":13814,"responses_3xx":0,"responses_4xx":9,"responses_5xx":0,"responses_xxx":0,"start":"2016-01-07 19:04:40 +0000","tags":{"component":{"CloudController":{"latency":{"50":0.009015199,"75":0.0107408015,"90":0.015104917100000005,"95":0.01916497394999999,"99":0.034486261410000024,"samples":1,"value":5e-07},"rate":[0.13613289933245148,0.13433569936308343,0.13565885617276216],"requests":1686,"responses_2xx":1684,"responses_3xx":0,"responses_4xx":2,"responses_5xx":0,"responses_xxx":0},"HM9K":{"latency":{"50":0.0033354,"75":0.00751815875,"90":0.011916812100000005,"95":0.013760064,"99":0.013760064,"samples":1,"value":5e-07},"rate":[1.6850238803894876e-12,5.816129919395257e-05,0.00045864309255845694],"requests":12,"responses_2xx":6,"responses_3xx":0,"responses_4xx":6,"responses_5xx":0,"responses_xxx":0},"dea-0":{"latency":{"50":0.001354994,"75":0.001642107,"90":0.0020699939000000003,"95":0.0025553900499999996,"99":0.003677146940000006,"samples":1,"value":5e-07},"rate":[1.0000000000000013,1.0000000002571303,0.9999994853579043],"requests":12103,"responses_2xx":12103,"responses_3xx":0,"responses_4xx":0,"responses_5xx":0,"responses_xxx":0},"uaa":{"latency":{"50":0.038288465,"75":0.245610809,"90":0.2877324668,"95":0.311816554,"99":0.311816554,"samples":1,"value":5e-07},"rate":[8.425119401947438e-13,2.9080649596976205e-05,0.00022931374141467497],"requests":17,"responses_2xx":17,"responses_3xx":0,"responses_4xx":0,"responses_5xx":0,"responses_xxx":0}}},"top10_app_requests":[{"application_id":"063f95f9-492c-456f-b569-737f69c04899","rpm":60,"rps":1}],"type":"Router","uptime":"0d:3h:22m:31s","urls":21,"uuid":"0-c7fd7d76-f8d8-46b7-7a1c-7a59bcf7e286"}
```

Specifying the `User-Agent` header with a value of `HTTP-Monitor/1.1` returns the current health of the router. Use this method for healthchecks from a load balancer. This endpoint does not require credentials and should be done against port 80. The *deprecated* `/healthz` endpoint provides a similar response but requires basic authentication. 

```
$ curl -v -A "HTTP-Monitor/1.1" "http://10.0.32.15"
* Rebuilt URL to: http://10.0.32.15/
* Hostname was NOT found in DNS cache
*   Trying 10.0.32.15...
* Connected to 10.0.32.15 (10.0.32.15) port 80 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> User-Agent: HTTP-Monitor/1.1
> Host: 10.0.32.15
> Accept: */*

* Connection #0 to host 10.0.32.15 left intact
```

The `/routes` endpoint returns the entire routing table as JSON. This endpoint requires basic authentication and is served on port 8080. Each route has an associated array of host:port entries.

```
$ curl "http://someuser:somepass@10.0.32.15:8080/routes"
{"0295dd314aaf582f201e655cbd74ade5.cloudfoundry.me":["127.0.0.1:34567"],"03e316d6aa375d1dc1153700da5f1798.cloudfoundry.me":["127.0.0.1:34568"]}
```

Because of the nature of the data present in `/varz` and `/routes`, they require http basic authentication credentials. These credentials can be found the BOSH manifest under the `router` job:

```
    status:
      password: zed292_bevesselled
      port:
      user: paronymy61-polaric
```

Or on the Gorouter VM under `/var/vcap/jobs/gorouter/config/gorouter.yml`:

```
status:
  port: 8080
  user: some_user
  pass: some_password
```

### Profiling the Server

The GoRouter runs the [cf_debug_server](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-debug-server), which is a wrapper around the go pprof tool. In order to generate this profile, do the following:

```bash
# Establish a SSH tunnel to your server (not necessary if you can connect directly)
ssh -L localhost:8080:[INTERNAL_SERVER_IP]:17001 vcap@[BOSH_DIRECTOR]
# Run the profile tool.
go tool pprof http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/profile
```

## Load Balancing

The GoRouter is, in simple terms, a reverse proxy that load balances between many backend instances. The implementation currently uses simple round-robin load balancing and will retry a request if the chosen backend does not accept the TCP connection.

## Logs

The router's logging is specified in its YAML configuration file. It supports the following log levels:

* `fatal` - A fatal error has occurred that makes gorouter unable to handle any requests.
Examples: the router can't bind to its TCP port, a CF component has published invalid data to the router.
* `error` - An unexpected error has occurred. Examples: the router failed to fetch token from UAA service.
* `info`, `debug` - An expected event has occurred. Examples: a new CF component was registered with the router, the router has begun
to prune routes for stale droplets.

Access logs provide information for the following fields when recieving a request:

`<Request Host> - [<Start Date>] "<Request Method> <Request URL> <Request Protocol>" <Status Code> <Bytes Received> <Bytes Sent> "<Referer>" "<User-Agent>" <Remote Address> x_forwarded_for:"<X-Forwarded-For>" x_forwarded_proto:"<X-Forwarded-Proto>" vcap_request_id:<X-Vcap-Request-ID> response_time:<Response Time> app_id:<Application ID> <Extra Headers>`
* Status Code, Response Time, Application ID, and Extra Headers are all optional fields
* The absence of Status Code, Response Time or Application ID will result in a "-" in the corresponding field

Access logs are also redirected to syslog.
